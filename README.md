# An R Package Validation Report

### Description

A Github Action that generates a validation report for an R package. The four main steps are:

- Run `R CMD check` (check installation)
- Run `covr::package_coverage()` (check unit test coverage)
- Run `covtracer` (link documentation to unit tests)
- Place results into report
- _If valtools present - run valtools and also publish report?_ (to discuss)
- Attach report as object to release

## How to use

To use this GitHub Action you will need to complete the following:

* Create a new file in your repository called `.github/workflows/r-pkg-validation.yml`
* Copy the template over (and edit if you wish to modify it)

### Quickstart

In your repository you should have a `.github/workflows/validatoR.yml` file with GitHub Action similar to below:

```yaml
---
name: R Package Validation report

on: # Run this action when a release is published
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  r-pkg-validation:
    name: Create report üìÉ
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: rocker/verse:4.1.1
    # Set Github token permissions
    env:
      GITHUB_PAT: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    permissions:
      contents: write
      packages: write
      deployments: write
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo üõé
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Build report üèó
        uses: insightsengineering/thevalidatoR@main
        # see parameters above for custom templates and other formats

      # Upload the validation report to the release
      - name: Upload report to release üîº
        if: success()
        uses: svenstaro/upload-release-action@v2
        with:
          file: ./validation_report.pdf
          asset_name: validation-report.pdf
          repo_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          tag: ${{ github.ref }}
          overwrite: false
```

### V1.0 Examples 

#### rbmi

You can see an example report from [rbmi](https://github.com/insightsengineering/rbmi), using the first version of this gh-action, [here](readme_files/report-1.0.1-rbmi.pdf).

This was built as a test on a fork of the original rbmi package. When we created a release in that fork, this PDF was automatically built and added to the release as can be seen below.

And you can see the gh-action action that was triggered by the release being published. Note that it must install the package, run tests and 
construct the metrics needed by cov-tracer and covr, which in the case of `rbmi` a computationally heavy package - took quite a while!

#### admiral

You can see an example report from [admiral](https://github.com/Roche-GSK/admiral), using the first version of this gh-action, [here](readme_files/report-0.1-admiral.pdf).
